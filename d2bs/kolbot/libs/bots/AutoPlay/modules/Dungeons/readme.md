# how to add
Any DungeonName.js file gets automatically loaded once the bot starts to do this dungeon.

Names of dungeons can be found in AreaData.

All this to keep Dungeon.js clear and readable, custom behaviour can be dynamically added.

# What if you dont add
With out a custom file, it does what it normally does -> find the next exit and walk to it
